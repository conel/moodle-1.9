	CONTRIB-1474 - added basic import tool that parses files in the
	mrcutejr repository folder and provides guesses for db values, then
	spits out an xls file which can be tweaked, converted to csv then
	reimported to very rapidly import a whole lot of files efficiently

	CONTRIB-1470 - Almost all files changed; update is primarily to
	make repository files be stored outside of site files & access to a
	resource only possible (to a student) if they have access to the
	course that the resource is made available in.	Other tweaks
	include: search improved (included realreference field), can
	include nested sub-directories, any editingteacher can now edit the
	repository (rather than username base as before), admin settings
	reduced to 1 optional setting, added * to required form fields,
	fixed a non-functioning "continue" button on a particular error
	screen.  See http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/CONTRIB-1470
