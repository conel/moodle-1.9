<p align="center"><strong>Size of Movie</strong></p>

<p>This setting affects the size of the movie displayed.</p>
<ul><li>Choosing <strong>'100% of Browser'</strong> will cause the movie to be enlarged to the full size of the browser window. <em>If you decide to show the Moodle header and footer on the page with your movie then these are still shown in this mode.</em> The browser will normally scroll to show just the movie but the user can scroll up or down to see the Moodle header and footer.</li>
<li>Choosing <strong>'Fixed pixel Dimensions as Set in Publish Settings'</strong> will cause your movie to be displayed at the exact same pixel that you set document properties before you publish your movie in the Flash authoring environment. It will be centred in the middle of the browser screen.</li></ul>
