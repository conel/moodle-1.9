<p align="center"><strong>Show grades on 'Results page'?</strong></p>

<p>The 'results page' is displayed when a user has taken this test before and answers to the test have been stored in the database. Some movies that don't store any user answers in the database and so no results page is ever shown.</p>
<p>You can choose whether to show grades on the results page. Particularly if your movie doesn't store a grade as part of the answer to a question it makes sense not to show any grades.</p>
<p>You may want to show grades for a graded activity but not have the grade count to the overall grade of the student. In this case set Maximum Grade to 'no grades'.</p>
