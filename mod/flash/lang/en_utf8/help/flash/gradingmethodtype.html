<p><strong>Grading methods for a Flash Activity</strong> : You can take a Flash Activity as many times as you want. The grading method used determines how your
 answers, when you do or don't repeat an activity, are taken into account when grading the activity. We either : </p>

<ol>
    <li>Look at the grades for each attempt at a question : <br>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Average Grade for Each Question</b> - This grading method looks at all your attempts at each question of the activity and takes
    the average of the grades you got for each question. Each average grade for each question is equally weighted and the average of these gives you your overall grade. </li>
    <li><b>Best Grade for Each Question</b> - This grading method looks at only
        the best grade you got for each question during any attempt at an activity. Each best grade for each question is equally weighted and the average of these gives you your overall grade for the whole activity. <br>
    </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Or consider entire attempts at an activity :<br>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Grade For Best Attempt At Entire Test</b> - For this grading method we look at all your 
    attempts at the activity. The best grade you got for an attempt at the entire activity is your overall grade then for this activity.</li>
    <li><b>Grade For Last Attempt At Test</b> - For this grading method we just look at your 
    last attempt at the activity. Your overall grade then for this activity is just the grade you got for your last attempt at this activity.</li>
    <li><b>Only First Attempt At Test is Graded</b> - For this grading method we look at only your 
    first attempt at the activity. Your overall grade then for this activity is just the grade you got for your first attempt at this activity. Repeating this activity will not affect your grade.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You may want to show grades for a graded activity but not have the grade count to the overall grade of the student. In this case set Maximum Grade to 'no grades'.</p>
