<p align="center"><strong>Preloader.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Flash MX learning interaction movie</strong>s which are created using the Flash MX quiz templates can be tracked by a preloader movie in Moodle. If you want to track such a movie then you should choose &quot;Yes, use Flash MX learning interactions movie loader and tracker&quot;. You will also need the file Flash MX learning interaction movie tracker service.php which is available from <a href="http://jamiep.org/">http://jamiep.org/</a> check see my wiki.</p>
<p>For <strong>movies other than Flash MX learning interaction movie</strong>s, the author of the Flash movie you are basing this activity on will have chosen whether to author his/her movie in such a way that it takes advantage of the preloader or not. You should check with them whether the movie you are basing this activity on (the movie you chose from the drop down list above) uses the preloader or not. Alternatively if you try first 'No preloader' and grades are not tracked or the movie freezes then you probably need change to 'Yes, use the regular font and movie loader'.</p>
