<p align="center"><strong>Movie</strong></p>

<p>Instructions for authoring Flash movies that will work within this Flash Activity are available at <a href="http://jamiep.org ">http://jamiep.org </a></p>
<p>Most movies just need to be uploaded to the directory <em>&quot;mod/flash/movies/{moviename}/&quot;</em> within your Moodle site (where <em>{moviename}</em> is the name of your movie and you have a minimum of two files <em>{moviename}.swf</em> and <em>{moviename}.html</em>) </p>
<p>Movies that have been uploaded to this directory will be automatically detected and will then appear in the 'Movie' drop down list.</p>
