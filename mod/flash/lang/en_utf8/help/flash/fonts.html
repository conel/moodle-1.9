<p>The Flash movie may load in fonts itself to use as embedded fonts or may rely on the preloader to load in fonts for use in the movie.</p>
<p>Embedded fonts allow you to use fonts that may not be installed on the system of the person viewing this activity, whether or not the fonts are installed on the remote system they will be usable within this Flash Activity and viewable on the remote system.</p>
<p>To embed fonts in your movies you need to package fonts in a special way and upload them to your web site. To package fonts so that they are selectable in the 'Activity Update' form and thus embedded in movies see instructions on my web site <a href="http://jamiep.org">http://jamiep.org</a></p>
<p>The advantage of embedding fonts in this way is : </p>
<ul><li>it allows one activity 'template' to be repurposed to work with many different character sets, ensuring that that character set will be displayable on the remote users computer. </li>
    <li>once they have been loaded by the remote user's browser they will normally be stored in that users 'cache' and won't need to be loaded each time a user views an activity which uses this font.</li>
    </ul>
