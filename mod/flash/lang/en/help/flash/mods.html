<p>The 'Flash Activity Module' allows Flash authors to integrate their Flash movies into Moodle as a Moodle activity.
It makes it easy to adapt Flash movies, with the minimum of coding, so that they can be used as activity modules within Moodle and  :</p>
<ul>
    <li>can be added as an 'Activity' to a Moodle course</li>
    <li>log activity so that it appears in Moodle Recent Activity block and Moodle logs</li>
    <li>optionally can be made repurposable (configurable)</li>
<li>optionally can store grades in the Moodle gradebook</li>
<li>optionally can store answers and times taken to do a question </li>
<li>diplay details to a user about their attempts at an activity</li>
<li>optionally can allow teachers to export grades from the grade book</li>
<li>cofiguration data, logs, answers and grades can be backed up and restored</li>
<li>a preloader allows movies to use preloaded unicode fonts or portions of fonts as if they were embedded in the movies themselves</li>
</ul>

<p>More information about how to author movies for use as Flash Activity modules may be found at <a href="http://jamiep.org">http://jamiep.org</a></p>
<p>As the module stands now activities normally consists of multiple questions and can be attempted as many times as the learner wants.</p>
