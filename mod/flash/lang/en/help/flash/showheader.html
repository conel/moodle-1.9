<p align="center"><strong>Show Header and Footer and Navigation Above and Below Movie?</strong></p>

<p>Normally the Moodle 'header' and 'footer' is displayed on every page in your Moodle course. The Moodle 'header' and 'footer' includes elements like your site logo and navigation drop down box, etc. You can choose whether to show the Moodle 'header' and 'footer' on the page with your Flash movie. In some cases it may be more appropriate not to show a header and footer on the same page as your movie.</p>
<p>This setting doesn't affect the display of the header and footer on the Flash activity results page and splash page.</p>
