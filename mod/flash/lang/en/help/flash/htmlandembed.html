<p align="center"><strong>About Using Embedded Fonts with HTML Formatted Text</strong></p>

<p>If  text is formatted using html and you have selected to use one or more embedded fonts for this text you should surround the text you use with font tags which tell Flash the font name of the font to use eg :</p>
<pre>&lt;font face=&quot;Lucida Sans Unicode&quot;&gt;Text here.&lt;/font&gt;
</pre>

<p>Use the original name of the font that you packaged using the font packaging extension. Make sure you have selected the font(s) for the preloader to load.</p>
<p>If you select embed fonts for text, all of the text must use embedded fonts. Any character not included in the fonts will not be displayed. If you want to use bold or italics with embedded fonts you must package the bold and italic font outlines in the font file. If you use bold or italics without embedding the bold and italic font outlines they will not display. </p>
