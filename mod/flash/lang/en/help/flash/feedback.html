<p align="center"><b><strong>Flash Activity</strong> Feedback</b></p>

<p>This is the feedback which will appear on the results page and will be viewable by the user after a user has taken the activity.</p>
<p><strong>Feedback</strong> : This is displayed when the user is logged in and has taken a test.</p>
<p><strong>Feedback For a Guest User</strong> : If guest users are allowed to do this test then this feedback is displayed when any guest user has taken the test. 
It is recommended not to display feedback on attempts at a test that will possibly give away the answer if this is a guest user.</p>
<p><strong>%Codes% for use in Feedback :</strong> Certain codes surrounded in percent signs will be replaced by values which have been communicated to Moodle from the Flash movie. Typically these will include :</p>
<p><ul>
    <li>%answer% - feedback about the answer that the learner gave. </li>
    <li>and %time% - the time it took for the learner to answer. </li>
    </ul>
<p>For <strong>Flash MX learning interaction movie</strong>s loaded and tracked with the preloader you can also use these codes :</p>
<ul>
    <li>%interaction_id% - the id that was given to the question when authoring the movie. </li>
    <li>%interaction_type% - the type of the interaction.</li>
</ul>
