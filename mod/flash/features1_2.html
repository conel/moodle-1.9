<p>Flash Activity Module Version 1.2</p>
<p>Some of the new features :</p>
<p><strong>More logging of activity with the Flash Activity Module.</strong> Answers are logged. You can view live logs, etc. </p>
<p><strong>Recent Activity block support added.</strong> Now you can see how many times an activity has been attempted since you logged in last.</p>
<p><strong>Contextual help added to config forms.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Extended 'moodleDebugger' </strong>I've added some new features to the debug view which is included in the 'preloader' (I ought to rename the preloader to something else probably as it does much more than preloading the fonts and movie now). When anything is output by your php service functions using for example echo, print or print_r then the output will be automatically displayed in the debug view. You can now switch to the debug view by pressing CTRL  D or by this action script moodleDebug.showDebug(); and then you can switch back to the movie which is running in the background by clicking on the 'go back to movie' link. If there is a comms error the error is now handled by displaying an error message in the debug view, when there is an error there is no option to go back to the movie.</p>
<p><strong>New 'preloader' allows you to track Flash MX Learning Interactions without using SCORM or AICC.</strong> Just for fun I wrote some code to track Flash MX 2004 Learning Interaction movies, risking severe caffeine poisoning in the process :). We can now track user activity and capture grades and answers from Flash MX 2004 Learning Interaction movies based on the Flash MX 2004 quiz template. No modifications to the Flash MX Learning Interaction movie are required. Instead of having Flash talk to javascript and pass the tracking info through a SCORM api which then passes the info to Moodle I have written a Flash movie that loads in the Flash MX Learning Interaction movie and then tracks it and sends tracking info to Moodle. This may be? a more robust and simpler alternative to using the SCORM module (for Flash MX Learning Interaction movies only). Not sure how the tracking capabilities compare (haven't used the SCORM module) but here are the features of this tracking method : </p>
<ul>
    <li>Live logs show answers submitted as the student submits them</li>
    <li>Take the test as many times as you like selectable grading methods -best grade for each question, average grade, grade for last test only, etc.</li>
    <li>No weights for grades unfortunately.</li>
    <li>Configurable feedback.</li>
    <li>No need for frames or popup windows.</li>
    <li>No scorm packaging required. </li>
    <li>Works on possibly a wider range of browsers ?? - no need for javascript, no need for Flash - js communications - two things which are not universally supported.</li>
    <li>We have access to the all of the internals of the quiz so we can easily extend tracking, to do whatever we want, almost.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Order movie extended.</strong> I've extended the 'order' movie where a student is asked to order text segments and renamed it 'order_and_select'. I've added a new question type where a student is asked to select words in a text based on a prompt. Eg. the prompt might be to select all words which are verbs or to select all words that are spelt wrong. The test creator specifies whether a particular word when selected is right or wrong or ignored. Grade for each text selection question is :</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><em>(right word count - wrong word count)*100 / expected right word count. </em></p>
    </blockquote>
<p>So now you can sequence text ordering and text selection questions as you like. </p>
<p>I've also cleaned up the code of the order movie. It is considerably easier to follow now I think and I've moved the code for the different questions into seperate class files. It would be easy to write another class for a new question type to extend this movie further. </p>
