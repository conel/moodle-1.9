	* config.php, mrcutejr.css, search.php,
	lang/en_utf8/resource_mrcutejr.php: 
	
	CONTRIB-1474 - added basic import tool that parses files in the
	mrcutejr repository folder and provides guesses for db values, then
	spits out an xls file which can be tweaked, converted to csv then
	reimported to very rapidly import a whole lot of files efficiently

	* Crypt_Xtea.php, get.php, mrcutejr_auth.php, preview.php: 
	
	CONTRIB-1470 - Update with the newly added files (dev is a little
	new to cvs); this update is primarily to make repository files be
	stored outside of site files & access to a resource only possible
	(to a student) if they have access to the course that the resource
	is made available in.  Other tweaks include: search improved
	(included realreference field), can include nested sub-directories,
	any editingteacher can now edit the repository (rather than
	username base as before), admin settings reduced to 1 optional
	setting, added * to required form fields, fixed a non-functioning
	"continue" button on a particular error screen.  See
	http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/CONTRIB-1470

	* mrcutejr.js: 
	
	Updated set_value() to insert description into resource summery in
	both cases: HTMLArea enabled or not (previously didn't work with
	HTMLArea enabled).  This may need further updating for Moodle 2.0
	when it's release (unless same code happens to work for however the
	new TinyMCE editor is implemented).
