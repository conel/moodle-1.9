Moodle module: Subcourse

The module provides very simple yet useful functionality. When added into a 
course, it behaves as a graded activity. The grade for each student is took 
from a final grade in another course. Combined with metacourses, this allows 
course designers to organize courses into separate units.  

See http://docs.moodle.org/en/Subcourse_module for more information.
