# Moodle 1.9

We've made a LOT of changes to the core code in our Moodle 1.9.  
So much so that I've not been able to do apply upgrades for fear of overriding changed functionality.  
When we move to Moodle 2.0 I'm never going to change core code.  
Until 4th of June 2010 I was documenting every change to the core code. 

These changes to the core code are documented in the #changes folder.  
There's a Word and Excel document. Also a text file so changes made are searchable in GitHub.
