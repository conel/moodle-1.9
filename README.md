# Moodle 1.9

### Changes
We've made a LOT of changes to the core code in our Moodle 1.9.  
I've not been able to upgrade for a long time, I fear overriding changed functionality.  

When we move to Moodle 2 I'm never going to change core code.  
Until the 4th of June 2010 I was documenting every change to the core code. 

These changes to the core code are documented in the [#changes](/conel/moodle-1.9/tree/master/%23changes) folder.  
There's a Word and Excel document. Also a text file so changes are searchable in GitHub.
