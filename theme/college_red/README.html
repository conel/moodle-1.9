<p>All my themes are 'work in progress' and continually under development. If you like this theme and use it yourself, 
let me know what types of modifications you make, I'd love to see them and maybe pinch some ideas for mine.</p>

<p>Thanks for the support in the <a href="http://www.moodle.org">Moodle.org</a> forums, Rachel for putting up with all the 
changes I keep making and Solent Uni for posting an example that solved my CSS menu headache!</p>

<p>In this way custom themes are not "left behind" by Moodle upgrades.</p>
