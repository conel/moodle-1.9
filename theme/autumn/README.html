<h3 style="margin-bottom:5px; margin-top:5px;">About</h3>

<p>This theme for Moodle was created by Patrick Malley of <a href="http://newschoollearning.com">NewSchool Learning</a> in May of 2007 as an experiment testing the flexibility of the Moodle CSS. Autumn, as it is now called, is based on, and uses background images from <a href="http://wpthemepark.com/themes/fallseason/">FallSeason</a> - a theme for Wordpress created by the talented <a href="http://wpthemepark.com">Sadish Bala</a>.</p>

<h3 style="margin-bottom:5px; margin-top:5px;">Changing the Header Image</h3>

<p>Since Autumn is a fluid-width theme (its width changes with the width of your browser window), any header image that you use will either have to a.) look good when repeated along an x-axis, or b.) be approximately 2000px wide to accomodate today's wide screens, yet look good when cropped to a smaller size.</p>

<p>I recommend the first option, and if you look closely at Autumn's front page, you can see where the "fall_leaves" image stops then starts again. </p>

<p>The default image used (pix/fall_leaves.jpg) is cropped at 149px tall, so any image that you decide to use instead should use this dimension as well to avoid excessive cropping. </p>
<p>To change this height value to something different, alter the following in styles.css (line 92):</p>
<code style="padding:5px;display:block;margin:20px;background:#eee;border:1px dashed #aaa;"><pre>#header-home .headerimg1 {
  height: 149px;
  margin-bottom: 2px;
  background: url(pix/fall_leaves.jpg) repeat-x bottom left;
}</pre></code>
